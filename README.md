# peeK-mobile

A multi platform mobile app used to interact with the peeK website.
It's sole purpose is to be able to have a native app to unlock and lock your house without having to use a web browser.

It is made using the Cordova framework and jQuery Mobile for easy functionality.
This was an extra and stretch goal for my final project at Wyncode Academy. It is something I am extremely proud of.
